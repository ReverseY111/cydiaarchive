Description: Myriam is an iOS App containing various vulnerabilities for you to discover and exploit. The application offers a few challenges for those of you who wanna become the next iOS hackers. Ranging from In-App Data modification to App Activation Bypass and Jailbreak Detection, to Touch ID Bypass, Myriam combines some great challenges for beginners with a nice intuitive design. Don't get me wrong, I am a beginner myself trying to learn, so this application is what I will be using in the first place, because it is easier to build such an app in Objective-C than to take it to bits in Hopper or IDA :) I hope you'll find it useful!
